## ðŸ“š Introduction

The nura-extension is an available extension usable with any [chromium](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-projects/) based browser. This includes `Chrome` and `Edge`. In order to use the nura extension, you have to first build it yourself since there is no official release up to this point. Furthermore, you need to have an account on your nura instance or use the official instance by clicking [here](https://nura.micartey.dev/login).
